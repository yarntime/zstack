            zone has two states: Enabled and Disabled.
            Enabled means resources in this zone is avaiable to manipulate where Disabled means no operation can be applied.
            currently, zone state won't effect any API, they are reserved for future.
            state changing of zone will cascade to its sub-resources: cluster and host. for example, disable a zone will disable
            all clusters and hosts which belong to this zone. However, if any sub-resources in the situation that its state cannot be
            changed, ancestral state changing of zone will fail
